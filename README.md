# wordpressXML2HTML
Simple script that just gets the text from a wordpress xml export file and exports the text of the post entries to HTML

Requires python3 

Usage for the script is:

usage: wordpressXML2HTML.py [-h] -f FILE -o OUTPUT [-n NUMBER] [-sd STARTDATE]
                            [-ed ENDDATE]

With this script the output can then be used by pandoc to get the entries from a blog into word or pdf format.
